Given the following list of database table summaries and the user question, select all tables that are possibly relevant to answer the question.
If you are unsure whether a table is relevant, it is better to include it.  
Err on the side of including more tables, rather than missing any table that might be needed.

Return the result as a JSON array of table names (strings).
Do not return anything except the JSON array. Do not include any explanation, comments, or markdown.

Format example:
["orders", "users"]

Table summaries:
{% for tbl in table_summaries %}
- Table: {{ tbl.id_table }}; Description: {{ tbl.description }}; Columns: {{ tbl.columns }}
{% endfor %}
------------
User question: {{ question }}
