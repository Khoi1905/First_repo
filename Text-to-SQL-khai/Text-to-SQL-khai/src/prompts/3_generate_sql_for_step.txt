Given the database schema, the original user question, all previous steps (with SQL code), and the current step, generate the SQL code for the current step.

**Return only the SQL code for this step. Do not include any explanation, comments, or markdown.**

Database schema (for your reference):
{% for tbl in table_descriptions %}
- Table: {{ tbl.table_name }}; Columns: [{% for col in tbl.columns %}{{ col.name }}{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}]
{% endfor %}

In addition to the above database tables, you may also use any intermediate tables or results that have been created in previous steps.

------------
User question: {{ user_question }}

{% if prev_context %}
Previous steps and their SQL:
{% for prev, sql in prev_context %}
Step {{ loop.index }}:
  Description: {{ prev.step_description }}
  Output requirement: {{ prev.expected_output }}
  SQL:
  {{ sql }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
No previous steps have been executed.
{% endif %}

Current step:
Description: {{ current_step.step_description }}
Operations: {{ current_step.table_operations }}
Expected output: {{ current_step.expected_output }}
